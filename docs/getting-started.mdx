## Installation

Install Project Key globally:

```bash
npm install -g projectkey
```

Or use it directly with `npx` without installing:

```bash
npx projectkey <command>
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Project Key

Create a configuration file in your project:

```bash
projectkey init
```

This creates a `projectkey.config.json` file with provider and environment settings.

### 2. Log in

Authenticate with a supported provider (e.g., GitHub):

```bash
projectkey login github
```

Project Key will handle the OAuth flow or token exchange and store an encrypted session locally.

### 3. Export for Your Framework

Generate framework-specific session files:

```bash
# For Playwright
projectkey export --framework=playwright

# For Cypress
projectkey export --framework=cypress
```

### 4. Use in Your Tests

**Playwright:**

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  storageState: '.projectkey/session.json',
});
```

**Cypress:**

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  cy.authkitLogin('github');
});
```

## CI/CD Mode

For non-interactive environments, use CI mode:

```bash
projectkey login github --ci
```

This uses stored credentials from environment variables or secrets instead of prompting for input.
