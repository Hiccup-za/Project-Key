## What is Project Key?

Project Key is a **universal authentication orchestrator** for developers and QA engineers.

It eliminates the friction of environment setup, login flows, and OTP handling in end-to-end automation by providing a secure, framework-agnostic way to inject authenticated sessions across local, staging, and production environments.

## The problem

Modern test automation is blocked by authentication and every framework requires the same painful setup steps:

1. Launch browser
2. Handle OAuth redirects
3. Retrieve OTPs or 2FA codes
4. Store environment-specific credentials
5. Retry when cookies expire

This process is **time-consuming, brittle, and not reusable** across projects. Most teams either:

- Stub login (breaking parity with production)
- Use manual cookies/tokens (unsafe and short-lived)

## Our solution

Project Key provides a single command and API to handle authentication setup for any E2E test runner.
It automatically:

- Performs secure login flows (OAuth, token, or cookie-based)
- Refreshes tokens or sessions before expiry
- Stores and encrypts session data
- Injects authentication state into test frameworks at runtime

It's **framework-agnostic**, **environment-aware**, and **production-safe**.
